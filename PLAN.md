# PLAN — Phased Roadmap

**Now — DEPLOYED + E2E-TESTED (2026-07-09).** All of Phase 1 (M0–M5) plus **M5.5 catalog admin**, **Phase 3a multi-brand fixed-order flow**, **Phase 3b LG manual pricing + admin approval**, and an **admin in-app User Management screen** (`/dashboard/users`) are ✅ complete, reviewer-verified, and **merged to `main`** (HEAD `7cfa185`). The app is **live in Vercel production at [direct-sales-nu.vercel.app](https://direct-sales-nu.vercel.app)** (prod from `main`, single Supabase prod project `ugjwcbxyyuowiyhczcrh`). **3 brands live:** Zebronics + Luminous (fixed price), **LG** (manual price + admin approval). A full **role-phased end-to-end test** (salesman → accountant → admin, chained, run via Google Antigravity) passed: **39/39 real tests green, 2 skipped by design, 0 defects** — the 3 reported "fails" were tester-perception artifacts (modal-open + URL-during-redirect), confirmed working ([tests/e2e-test-plan.md](tests/e2e-test-plan.md), [tests/test-results.json](tests/test-results.json)); tester data was purged from prod afterward. **Real accounts exist** (3 salesmen, 1 accountant, 1 admin; username login, D9) and **606 retailers** are imported. **Remaining before general rollout: the 1-week parallel-with-notebook pilot** (rollout gate below). Decisions live in [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md); specs in [docs/specs/](docs/specs/) are the source of truth. Work happens on **feature branches with granular commits**; every commit is reviewed by the REVIEWER in [comments.md](comments.md), and blocking findings are fixed in the very next commit.

## Phase 1 — Core MVP: digital order capture

**Goal:** kill the notebook. Salesman captures orders on his phone faster than paper; accountant sees them live, locks them, prints pick slips for the godown. (Honest scope: the accountant still types into Tally until Phase 2 — Phase 1 buys legibility, latency, and visibility.)

### Milestones

| # | Milestone | Exit criteria | Status · 2026-07-07 |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~**M0**~~ | ~~**Design pass**~~ — a DESIGNER session reads this repo and authors `Prompts/phase1-design-prompt.md` per [design/design-brief.md](design/design-brief.md) (kickoff: `Prompts/designer-session-prompt.md`); **Claude design** then produces the Phase 1 screen designs from that self-contained file | Designs for the 11 screens approved by the owner; the completing commit records who approved and when | ✅ **Done** — approved by Mridul 2026-07-06 (`c82607e`) |
| ~~**M1**~~ | **Scaffold + schema** — Next.js app; Supabase dev project; migrations implementing [data-model](docs/specs/data-model.md), [lifecycle](docs/specs/order-lifecycle.md) RPCs/triggers, and the full [RLS matrix](docs/specs/roles-and-permissions.md) | REVIEWER passes all 6 items of the RLS verification protocol | ✅ **Done** — 11 migrations live & reviewer-verified (M1.1–M1.9); **RLS 6-step ✅**, RPC suite ✅, provisioning ✅. Next.js app scaffolded (App Router/TS, `@supabase/ssr`), production build green |
| **M2** | **Seed** — `scripts/seed.ts` per [seed-data.md](docs/specs/seed-data.md) | All post-seed verification queries pass; salesman client sees exactly 34 products | ✅ **Data done** — 42 products seeded, salesman sees 34, checks pass (M1.7). Drift-protected `scripts/seed.ts` loader deferred to app scaffold (ledger ⑬) |
| ~~**M3**~~ | **Auth + roles** — login flow, provisioning runbook executed for the real team | Each role logs in and sees only what the matrix allows | ✅ **Done** — S1 login (username→email via secret-key lookup, D9), middleware route-protection + role routing, deactivated-user lockout — all reviewer-verified live. Real-team account creation = a Dashboard runbook step at go-live |
| ~~**M4**~~ | **Salesman app** per [salesman-app.md](docs/specs/salesman-app.md) | All 6 acceptance criteria, incl. the 90-second stopwatch test and airplane-mode drills | ✅ **Done** — S3–S7 built (`feature/salesman-app`), all commits reviewer-accepted; idempotent submit, double-tap→one row, and the post-expiry server-side reject **proven live** by the REVIEWER against the real DB. Owner ran the 90s stopwatch test live — passed. Airplane-mode drill deferred (owner, later); not blocking. Two device bugs found in real phone testing fixed along the way: the sticky bottom-bar visibility, and `crypto.randomUUID()` throwing in the insecure (LAN-http) context |
| ~~**M5**~~ | **Accountant dashboard** per [accountant-dashboard.md](docs/specs/accountant-dashboard.md) | All 6 acceptance criteria, incl. live-appearance ≤5s and A4 pick-slip print | ✅ **Done** — Orders (S8 list + S9 workbench + S10 pick-slip) · Retailers (S11 verify queue) · Products (in-app pricing) as a 3-tab dashboard, desktop + phone; Realtime live-updates, post-lock edit-reason RPC (`p_reason`), TBD→salesman-visible — all reviewer-verified live. Owner deviations: phone version + in-app Products tab; users stay in Supabase ([add-user-runbook](docs/add-user-runbook.md)) |
| ~~**M5.5**~~ | **Catalog admin** — admin adds products two ways: a manual **+ Add product** form and a brand-scoped **Excel import** (SheetJS) | Admin adds/updates products in-app (single + bulk); import shows a **New/Updated/Errors dry-run preview** then applies; **upsert on `(brand_id, tally_name)`**, never duplicates; **drops the invented `sku`** | ✅ **Done 2026-07-07** — 4 commits, all reviewer-✅; manual modal + Excel import wizard live |
| ~~**P3a**~~ | **Multi-brand fixed order flow** (Phase 3 pulled forward) — first-class `orders.brand_id`, brand picker in the salesman flow, **one-brand-per-order guard**, brand-coded refs (`ORD-ZEB-2026-…`) | ≥2 fixed brands orderable end-to-end | ✅ **Done** — Zebronics + Luminous live; brand lock + brand column/filter shipped |
| ~~**P3b**~~ | **LG manual pricing + admin approval** (Phase 3 pulled forward) — `pending_approval`/`approved` statuses, admin-only **`approve_order`** RPC, `process_order` gated on approval, reject = cancel-with-reason, `brands.pricing_mode='manual'` + `requires_approval` + `show_model` | An LG order needs an **admin** to approve before it can be processed | ✅ **Done** — merged; verified live + by E2E |
| ~~**UM**~~ | **Admin User Management** — in-app `/dashboard/users`: create / edit / **reset-password (no email)** / deactivate via server-only service-role Server Actions | Admin manages logins in-app; **double gate** (page redirect + per-action `requireAdmin()`); self-lockout + last-admin guards; non-admin fail-closed | ✅ **Done** — proven fail-closed by live RLS impersonation + E2E; supersedes "users stay in Supabase" ([add-user-runbook](docs/add-user-runbook.md) is now the fallback) |
| ~~**QA**~~ | **End-to-end test pass** — role-phased, chained suite executed in-browser (Google Antigravity) | Full salesman → accountant → admin flow green, incl. RLS isolation, approval chain, all permission gates | ✅ **Done 2026-07-09** — 39 pass / 2 skipped / **0 defects**; [tests/e2e-test-plan.md](tests/e2e-test-plan.md) |
| **M6** | **Deploy + pilot** — Vercel prod, Supabase prod, real accounts, onboard 1 salesman + accountant | Rollout gate below | 🟨 **Deploy DONE** — live at [direct-sales-nu.vercel.app](https://direct-sales-nu.vercel.app), real accounts created, E2E-tested; **pending: the 1-week parallel-with-notebook pilot** |

### Open items — full mirror of the review ledger

No 🔴 blocking items. Everything below is non-blocking / deferred / owner-config. The REVIEWER's ledger atop [comments.md](comments.md) is the live source; mirrored here in full per owner request (2026-07-07).

| Flag | Item | Type | Home / next step |
|---|---|---|---|
| ㉗(b) | HISTORY renders real staff names, not a generic "the office" | owner-confirm | ✅ **Resolved 2026-07-07 (D10)** — owner confirms **real names**; current behavior stays, no change |
| ㉒ | `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` in `.env.local` + Vercel env | config / owner | ✅ **Resolved 2026-07-07** — set in both `.env.local` **and Vercel env** (owner) |
| ⑯ | Leaked-password protection (HaveIBeenPwned) | config / owner | ❌ **Declined 2026-07-07** — owner not doing it (also Pro-only, and owner is staying on free tier) |
| ㉛ | Least-privilege on `order_no_seq` — `anon`/`authenticated` hold default Supabase sequence grants (`USAGE`/`UPDATE`) they don't need. **Not exploitable** (no API path exposes `setval`/`nextval` — they're in `pg_catalog`, not the exposed schema; and `submit_order` is `security definer`, running the sequence as its owner). `revoke select, usage, update on sequence public.order_no_seq from anon, authenticated;` then confirm `submit_order` still assigns `order_no`. | hardening / deferred | **Owner: not required now** — do at go-live hardening (reviewer finding 2026-07-07) |
| ⑬ | Drift-protected `scripts/seed.ts` loader (warn/skip on price-drift re-run, `--force-prices` override) | minor / deferred | Buildable now (Node exists); do when a re-seed is first needed |
| ⑭ | RLS/index performance pass — 4 `get_advisors(performance)` categories (6 unindexed FKs incl. `orders.cancelled_by`, unwrapped `auth.uid()` in policies, multiple permissive policies, 1 unused index). Verified accurate + harmless at current scale | minor / deferred | Parked in [docs/future-plans.md](docs/future-plans.md); revisit with the Pro-billing decision |
| ⑦ | `sec-s6` render absent vs the "sec-s1…s8" range label | minor / doc | ✅ **Resolved 2026-07-07** — deviation #5 now notes `sec-s6` is absent (range label is nominal) |
| ⑧ | Design spec's "future Payments tab" forward-ref had no target | minor / doc | ✅ **Resolved 2026-07-07** — added a Payments-tab parking entry to [future-plans.md](docs/future-plans.md) |
| ⑨ | S1/S8 spec text showed the GE monogram vs the built receipt glyph | minor / doc | ✅ **Resolved 2026-07-07** — S1 + S8 text reconciled to the receipt-glyph mark (deviation #6) |

Closed flags (audit trail retained in [comments.md](comments.md)): ⑩ RLS fail-open · ⑪ `current_role` rename · ⑫ trigger `search_path` · ⑮ D8 self-cancel scope · ⑰ lint gate · ⑱ middleware cookie-drop · ⑲ font-var cycle · ⑳ S2 D8 filter · ㉑ username email-harvest · ㉓ offline misclassification · ㉔ zero-qty payload · ㉕ stale/deactivated catalog line · ㉖ silent pending-order discard · ㉗(a) overpromising offline copy.

### Rollout gate (adoption is the metric)

1. Pilot: one salesman, one route, **one week running app + notebook in parallel**.
2. Compare: capture time, error/dispute count, accountant effort.
3. The salesman chooses the app voluntarily → cut over; keep paper as fallback for one more week.
4. **Billing (owner 2026-07-07): staying on free tier for now — no Supabase/Vercel Pro.** Supabase free pauses after ~1 week *idle*, so an actively-used pilot is fine; revisit only if it actually pauses. (Vercel Hobby is technically non-commercial — a licensing note, not a pilot blocker.)

### In-phase choices (either is fine — builder decides at the milestone)

Realtime vs 30s polling for the dashboard · Tailwind vs vanilla CSS · PWA manifest for add-to-home-screen (cheap, do it at M4).

## Phase 2 — Tally integration: kill the re-typing

**Goal:** processed orders enter Tally without manual transcription. **This is a master-data mapping project first and a file-format project second.**

1. **Mapping sprint:** retailer ↔ Tally party-ledger names (the verification queue from Phase 1 already forces canonical spellings; fill `tally_ledger_name`), product ↔ stock-item names (`tally_name`), units, godown, and the inclusive-of-tax rate setting (D5).
2. **Voucher type decision (with the accountant):** recommended = import as **Sales Order** vouchers — matches the real flow (order → pick → deliver → bill) and leaves statutory invoicing inside Tally; alternative = direct Sales Invoice import.
3. **Path A (build):** dashboard exports selected processed orders as a Tally XML file; accountant imports via Gateway of Tally. Always tested against a **test company file** first.
4. **Idempotency:** exported orders are marked (`exported_at`); re-export warns; voucher narration carries `order_ref` for traceability both ways.
5. **Path C (only if A hurts):** a tiny local sync agent on the office PC pulls processed orders and POSTs XML to Tally's local HTTP port. At <20 orders/day, Path A's two clicks may be the permanent answer. **Topology + directional-sync design (incl. Tally→app master/balance pulls): [docs/phase2-tally-sync-design.md](docs/phase2-tally-sync-design.md).**
6. ~~Path B — browser pushes to `localhost:9000`~~ — dead end (CORS/Private Network Access/mixed content); see graveyard in [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md).

**Acceptance:** an order placed on a phone appears in the Tally test company with correct party, items, quantities, and inclusive rates — zero re-typing; re-export creates no duplicate vouchers.

---

## Phase 3 — Multi-brand ✅ SHIPPED (pulled forward, 2026-07-08)

**Goal:** cover the other brands' visit rounds (D4 confirmed rounds are brand-separate). **Architecture in [docs/phase3-multi-brand-design.md](docs/phase3-multi-brand-design.md)** — first-class `orders.brand_id` (+ a submit brand-guard enforcing one-brand-per-order), and order refs gain a **brand code** (`ORD-ZEB-2026-1042`; global-sequence Option A used).

- **Phase 3a — fixed brands (done):** Zebronics + Luminous live and orderable; brand picker + **brand lock** (cart locks to first item's brand) in the salesman flow; brand column + filter on the dashboard.
- **Phase 3b — LG manual pricing + approval (done):** LG is a `pricing_mode='manual'` + `requires_approval` brand — the salesman enters the price (no list/floor), the order lands in **`pending_approval`**, and an **admin** must **`approve_order`** (the first genuinely admin-only in-app power, breaking D11's admin≡accountant) before it can be `process`ed; reject = cancel-with-reason; adds `orders.approved_at/by`. Also `brands.show_model` → LG rows render the model prefix (`LG 43UA73806LA・UHD TV 43"`).

**Acceptance (met):** three brands live; a salesman starts the right brand round in ≤1 tap; pick slips are unambiguous about brand; LG's approval loop round-trips (verified live + by the E2E suite).

---

## Phase 4 — Collections visibility (read-only)

**Goal:** the salesman sees a shop's outstanding before walking in — the credit cycle is half the business and today lives only in Tally.

- **Start:** accountant exports Tally's ledger-wise outstanding weekly → uploads CSV to the dashboard → app shows "Outstanding: ₹12,400 (as of Mon)" on the retailer picker and order screens.
- **Later:** the Phase 2 sync agent (if built) pushes balances automatically.
- **Scope guard:** strictly read-only. No payment recording in the app — money stays Tally's.

**Acceptance:** outstanding + as-of date visible at retailer pick time; a stale upload is visibly stale.

---

## Phase 5 — Controlled pricing & negotiation

**Goal:** let salesmen negotiate without breaking accounting. Predefined **discount tiers** (e.g. 2/5/10% buttons — no free-typing prices) + **approval workflow**: below-floor discounts flip the order to `pending_approval` (status headroom exists) for accountant/owner approval before processing. Every override lands in `order_events`.

**Acceptance:** arbitrary prices are impossible; the approval loop round-trips on real devices; the audit trail names who approved what.

---

## Phase 6 — Native-feel & performance (later)

**Goal:** make the deployed app feel like a native app — instant tab switches, no "press → freeze → snap-in ~2s later" — **without a native rewrite.** The app is *already* a standalone installable PWA (`src/app/manifest.ts` `display:standalone` + `public/sw.js` + `SwRegister`); this phase closes the *speed* gap, not the "is it an app" gap.

**Owner framing (2026-07-11):** *"cache everything except the data."* The classic **app-shell PWA model** — cache the shell (JS/CSS/routes) so it opens instantly; keep data live over the network but **client-cache** it so a revisited tab renders instantly from cache and revalidates in the background. That (mounted shell + cached data) is exactly why the YouTube web app's tabs feel instant — not "because it's native."

**The work (impact order):**
1. **`loading.tsx` skeletons on every route** — only **2 of 13** routes have one today, so navigations freeze until the server render finishes. Instant feedback, low effort, no risk. *(Biggest perceived-speed win.)*
2. **Client-side data caching** (React Query / SWR) on the hot lists (Orders / Retailers / Products) — there is **no cache lib today** (all SSR server-fetch), so every tab is a fresh round-trip. *(Biggest actual "instant tab" lever.)*
3. **Prefetch** tab data + keep the app shell mounted so only the content swaps.
4. **Service-worker shell caching** — the SW is a minimal passthrough today; cache the static shell so the app opens instantly (data still fetched fresh).
5. **Cut per-navigation server cost** — the middleware runs `getUser()` (auth-server round-trip) + a `profiles` query on **every** request; carry role/active in the session instead. Add the deferred FK indexes (⑭). Confirm Vercel functions + Supabase are **same region**.
6. **Push the PWA install** — get staff to "Add to Home Screen" (already `standalone`) for the icon + fullscreen look.
7. **Trim `router.refresh()`** where a local state update suffices (each is a full server re-fetch).

**Explicitly NOT doing:** a **native rewrite** (React Native/Expo — full frontend rewrite, backend reusable; only worth it later for app-store distribution or deep native hardware beyond the camera the PWA already reaches) or a **Capacitor wrap** (same web app in a WebView → tabs stay just as slow; doesn't solve the problem). Full diagnosis + rationale in [docs/future-plans.md](docs/future-plans.md).

**Revisit when:** post-pilot, once the team is on the app daily and navigation latency is the top complaint.

---

## Unscheduled — [docs/future-plans.md](docs/future-plans.md)

Owner-approved ideas parked outside the committed phases (currently: **order-punch geotagging** — fail-open GPS fix at submit, order tags only, quiet presentation; **RLS/index performance pass** — 4 harmless-at-current-scale `get_advisors(performance)` findings from M1, revisit alongside the billing decision below or if real volume growth makes them matter; **"Cancelled orders" view for the salesman** — the un-hide screen for D8's default-hidden self-cancels, unscheduled until a real ask surfaces; **username-only auth** — swap D9's real-email-lookup login for synthetic `username@…` emails, simpler but reverses working code + needs account recreation, deferred by owner 2026-07-07).

## Open questions

| # | Question | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Edit window — **2 hours** | ✅ **Confirmed 2026-07-07 (owner)** |
| 2 | Retailer master: seed from a Tally ledger export? (Best option — names then pre-match for Phase 2) | Owner + accountant |
| 3 | CSV provenance: do product names mirror Tally stock-item names? Decides when display-name typos get cleaned | Accountant |
| 4 | Pick slip: A4 laser or thermal printer? | Owner |
| 5 | Go-live billing | **Owner 2026-07-07: free tier for now (no Pro).** Caveat: Supabase free pauses after ~1 week *idle* — fine for an active pilot; revisit only if it pauses |
| 6 | Godown phone view (read-only pick list) as Phase 1.5 if printing annoys | Later |
| 7 | Leaked-password protection (⑯) | ❌ **Owner declined 2026-07-07** — not doing (also Pro-only) |

## Changelog discipline

Decision changes hit [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) first; affected specs update in the same commit; milestone completion is claimed in the commit message and verified by the REVIEWER before it counts.
